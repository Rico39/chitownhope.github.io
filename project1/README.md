### Necessary Deliverables

* A **working game, built by you**, hosted somewhere on the internet
* A **link to your hosted working game** in the URL section of your Github repo. This must be placed inside of `your_username.github.io` in a folder called `project1`. It will then be accessible via http://your_username.github.io/project1/
* A **git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted game, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project. We strongly encourage you to work our of the repository `your_username.github.io`
* **A ``readme.md`` file** with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.

* **Render a game in the browser**
* **Switch turns** between two players
* **Design logic for winning** & **visually display which player won**
* **Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files**
* Stick with **KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid)** and **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** principles
* Use **Javascript or jQuery** for **DOM manipulation**
* **Deploy your game online**, where the rest of the world can access it
* Use **semantic markup** for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)

### Overview
Game Type: mystery solver
Objective:  find clues and solve the crime before the timer ends

---

*The main "machine" that my game is built on is the css :hover.  it allows my players to find the clues.
*I used a function to restart the game, which would prove to be invaluable should i create new mysteries for the game in the future.
*also, a timer is used to add a **dynamic** element to my game since it is a one player game. when the timer runs out, the player is directed to an "unsolved" page i.e. player did not solve the crime in time
*My main problem with the game project is: Javascript...my difficulties made it hard for me to incorporate more JS in my game
**I am working on JS outside of class using online resources
